# UnchainedText

## Description

UnchainedText is more than just an app; it's the key to unlock text trapped in PDF files. Let's face it: who really enjoys dealing with PDFs? They take up space, are static, and, frankly, are annoying. Let's not sugarcoat it, PDFs are often mass-produced, often without a real purpose, maybe just to stroke the author's ego or promote an image of intellectualism. But let's not get into that discussion... at least not now. I prefer to embrace the freedom offered by formats like .md, .html, and especially .epub. They allow us to consume information across various devices, saving space on disk or in the cloud. In short, UnchainedText is the answer for those looking to break free from the vicious cycle of PDFs.

## Features

- Easily extracts text from PDF files into plain text format, ready for preprocessing.
- Provides an efficient solution for text preprocessing, freeing you up to focus on other important tasks.
- I am considering sharing more features; I'm still reflecting on that...

## Usage

You can run UnchainedText locally or in your private and egoistic repository. For more details on how to use this amazing tool, visit the Project Wiki.

## Contribution

Thank you for choosing UnchainedText for your text extraction needs. With it, I have the freedom to save space for my precious .flac files while making room for the truly important things in life, like funny memes and cat gifs. After all, who needs to worry about space when you can enjoy a PDF-free experience and all the extra space that UnchainedText provides?
